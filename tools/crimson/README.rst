SeaStore rados bench profiler
=============================

We can profile SeaStore using rados bench with 1 OSD.

To start the test envionment:

.. code-block:: console

     $ MGR=0 MON=1 OSD=1 MDS=0 RGW=0 ../src/vstart.sh -n -x --without-dashboard --seastore --crimson --nodaemon --redirect-output
     $ ./bin/ceph osd pool create test-pool 5 5
     $ ./bin/ceph osd pool set test-pool size 1 --yes-i-really-mean-it

Then run ``seastore_radosbench_run.sh`` to generate workload and collect
metrics.

Finally, run ``seastore_metrics_analyze.py`` to generate diagram from the
collected metrics.

SeaStore fio bench profiler
===========================

We can profile SeaStore using fio bench with 1 OSD.

To start the test envionment:

.. code-block:: console

     $ MGR=0 MON=1 OSD=1 MDS=0 RGW=0 ../src/vstart.sh -n -x --without-dashboard --seastore --crimson --nodaemon --redirect-output

Then run ``seastore_fio_run.sh`` to generate workload and collect
metrics.

Finally, run ``seastore_metrics_analyze.py`` to generate diagram from the
collected metrics.

example rbd_write.fio:

.. code-block:: ini

  [global]
  ioengine=rbd
  clientname=admin
  pool=rbd
  rbdname=fio_test
  rw=randwrite
  bs=4K
  runtime=60
  numjobs=1
  direct=1
  group_reporting

  [rbd_iodepth32]
  iodepth=2

SeaStore metrics profiler
=========================

This is a client-independent and non-stop way to collect metrics for profiling.

Without the client providing the client IO size and number, it assumes the
information from the metrics of committing OBJ_DATA_BLOCK extents.

Since metric files are labeled with time, all the existing plots are changed to
use time as x-axis, and the non-stop way makes it possible to include seastar
metrics correctly.

To start tests, prepare the crimson cluster correctly with seastore, generate
the desired workload, and run ``seastore_metrics_run.sh`` to collect the
metrics.

Finally, run ``seastore_metrics_analyze.py`` to generate plots in png format.

Crimson bench tool
=======================

This is a crimson bench tool for multiple clients osd writing test.
Users can set the number of clients, threads, cores, which kind of test to
run (eg. rados bench or fio), which processors will bench threads and osd threads
execute on, test time, block size, etc.
Meanwhile, users can set the basic test cases and the clients ratio of each 
type of test case threads running in the same time, for example, 75% of the 
write clients and 25% of the read clients.
Then the tool will integrate IOPS, Bandwidth, Latency, seastar reactor 
utilization, cpu cycle, and other targets to help user analyze 
crimson osd performance.

To use this tool, prepare the python3 environment. You don't need to start a 
ceph cluster because the tool will do that. Put this tool in the ceph build 
directory. Since we will decide which processors the bench threads execute on
, sudo is needed.

Run ``./crimson_bench_tool.py --help`` to get the detail parameter information.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ./crimson_bench_tool.py \
        --client 4 8 --thread 2 4 6 --bench-taskset 16-31 --time 60 \
        --block-size 4096 \
        --crimson --store seastore --dev /dev/nvme4n1 \
        --rand-write 0.75 \
        --rand-read 0.25 \
        --ru 3 \
        --perf \
        --freq 6

The tool will run rados bench write and read test case with the combination 
of 4 or 8 clients and 2, 4 or 6 threads. In Every test case, there will be 75% of
write clients in all clients and the read clients will be 25%. Also, you can set
read clients ratio to 0 to do the write only tests, vive versa.
Meanwhile, it will collect the reactor cpu utilization for three time points(15s,
30s, 45s for this case) and cpu frequence for 6 time points(8s, 16s, 24s, 32s, 40s
, 48s, 56s for this case) and the perf information.
The test thread will run in processors 16~31. In consideration of SeaStore starts 
in processor 0 by default, please avoid setting --bench-taskset to 0.
The tests will run in crimson seastore.

Crimson stress visualizer
=========================

This is a drawing tool for turn data into visualizations conveniently after
you finish test using stress tool. Common tasks are also supported after
customize the script according to your own needs.

The tool will load data in csv format to Dataframe and will concatenate
the results automatically. Considering data in different scenarios, we
use the args ``--divide`` to distinguish them using the Cartesian Product
of given types.For example, given Block_size(4K, 4M) and OPtype(read, write),
you will get 4 figures with each combination.

Third-party drawing libraries Seaborn and Matplotlib are called in this tool.
pandas.Dataframe is also used to operate data.If you want to change plotting
settings in more detail, go to these websites for more help.

* https://seaborn.pydata.org/
* https://matplotlib.org/
* https://pandas.pydata.org/

Before use, prepare the python3 environment, install the dependencies and see
the help information to start.

* Run ``./crimson_stress_visualizer --help`` to get the detail parameter information.
* Run ``./crimson_stress_visualizer --show-available`` to get the existing tasks and figure types.
* Run ``./crimson_stress_visualizer --task-info`` to get the detail task information.

Existing task:

* "ceph":Common ceph drawing task to compare osd's performance.
* "ceph-bandwidth":Combine client bandwidth and device bandwidth.
* "crimson-utilization":Combine cpu-utilization and reactor-utilization.

Currently, these tasks only support result data with single type of read or write.
Simultaneous different types of operations by stress_tool are not supported.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    ./crimson_stress_tool.py \
        --thread-list  1 2 4 8 16 32 64 --client-list 1 \
        --bench-taskset=16-31 --block-size 4K --time=60 \
        --rand-write 1 \
        --store bluestore \
        --output classic_randwrite_4K \
        --perf --iostat --freq

    ./crimson_stress_visualizer.py \
        --data classic_randwrite_4K.csv \
        classic_single_randwrite_4K.csv \
        crimson_randwrite_4K.csv \
        --task ceph \
        --fig-type line

After using stress tool, the visualizer will read these three csv outcomes.
The ceph task will generate a figure that indicates the latency in different
threads with the crimson and classic osd. You can add args to ``--task-args``
to change the X, Y, Z variable.
