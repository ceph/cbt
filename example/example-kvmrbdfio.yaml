# this example lets you run kvmrbdfio.py benchmark
# inside a single-host Ceph cluster on a virtual machine,
# using a kernel RBD device as a simulated virtual disk
# of course, the storage pool for the /dev/rbd1 must
# be replicated using a crush rule like:
# # ceph osd crush rule create-simple too-few-hosts myvm osd
# and then you create the storage pool using
# # ceph osd pool create mypool 32 32 too-few-hosts
