# Plotter
Draws the hockey stick plots for a benchmark run from the data produced by the formatter. These are svg files, with one
plot produced per block size used.

There is also a python class that will produce comparison plots of two or more different CBT runs for one or more block 
sizes.
Due to the tools used there are only 6 unique colours available for the plot lines, so it is recommended to limit the
comparison to 6 or less files or directories.

## Standalone script
There is no standalone scropt for using the plotter
